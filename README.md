# CudaBasics

This project contains two small CUDA programs:

* `vector_add.cu`: adds two vectors on the CPU and GPU, then compares the results.
* `matrix_mul.cu`:  multiplies two matrices on the CPU and GPU, then compares the results.
* `atomic.cu`: compares non atomic and atomic counters.

Both examples use basic CUDA kernels and memory copies to show how to run computations on the GPU.
